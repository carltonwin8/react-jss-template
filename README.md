# React JSS Template

Basic template with react and jss.
The code in this repository is based of
[PWA](https://github.com/carltonwin8/pwa-tutorial-1).

The `webpack-dev-server` is used as a server.
It does not live-reload or hot reload because my pages are not in it's
dependency graph (only a dummy `index.js` so it does not error out).
